# Back-Propogation-Algorithm
Developed script to perform the back propagation algorithm for 1 iteration based on the delta rule using Python infrastructure and coding language with math module. The inputs as well as learning rate was given from example problem detailed in class. The algorithm works by first taking in two random inputs and after calculating error then backpropagates the error change across the synapses to hidden and then input layer in order to learn.
